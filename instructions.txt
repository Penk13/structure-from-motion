üîß CAMERA CALIBRATION

Before performing 3D reconstruction, you need to calibrate your camera:

1. PREPARE CALIBRATION DATA:
   ‚Ä¢ Print a chessboard pattern (recommended: 10x7 inner corners)
   ‚Ä¢ Take 15-30 photos of the chessboard from different angles and distances
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure the entire chessboard is visible in each image
   ‚Ä¢ Or record a video moving the chessboard around

2. RUN CALIBRATION:
   ‚Ä¢ Go to "Camera Calibration" tab
   ‚Ä¢ Select your calibration images directory or video file
   ‚Ä¢ Set the correct chessboard size (inner corners count)
   ‚Ä¢ For video: adjust frame skip (30 = process every 30th frame)
   ‚Ä¢ Click "Run Camera Calibration"
   ‚Ä¢ The camera matrix (K) will be saved automatically

üì∏ STRUCTURE FROM MOTION (3D RECONSTRUCTION)

After camera calibration, create your 3D model:

1. PREPARE INPUT DATA:
   ‚Ä¢ Take multiple photos of your object from different viewpoints
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure good overlap between consecutive images (60-80%)
   ‚Ä¢ Use consistent lighting and avoid reflective surfaces
   ‚Ä¢ Or record a video moving around the object

2. RUN 3D RECONSTRUCTION:
   ‚Ä¢ Go to "Structure from Motion" tab
   ‚Ä¢ Select your image directory or video file
   ‚Ä¢ Browse and select the camera matrix file (K) from calibration
   ‚Ä¢ Choose output format (PLY or OBJ)
   ‚Ä¢ Click "Start 3D Reconstruction"

üìã IMPORTANT TIPS:

‚Ä¢ IMAGE QUALITY:
  - Use high resolution images (1080p or higher)
  - Avoid motion blur and ensure sharp focus
  - Maintain consistent exposure settings

‚Ä¢ CAMERA MOVEMENT:
  - Move camera smoothly around the object
  - Keep the object in frame at all times
  - Capture from multiple heights and angles

‚Ä¢ LIGHTING:
  - Use diffused, even lighting
  - Avoid harsh shadows and reflections
  - Outdoor overcast conditions work well

‚Ä¢ FILE ORGANIZATION:
  - Keep images in a dedicated folder
  - Use sequential naming (IMG_001.jpg, IMG_002.jpg, etc.)
  - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF

üéØ WORKFLOW SUMMARY:

1. Calibrate camera using chessboard pattern
2. Capture images/video of target object
3. Run Structure from Motion with calibrated camera
4. View results in 3D modeling software (Blender, MeshLab, etc.)

‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING:

‚Ä¢ If calibration fails: Take more chessboard images with better variety
‚Ä¢ If reconstruction fails: Check image overlap and camera matrix file
‚Ä¢ Poor results: Improve lighting and reduce reflective surfaces
‚Ä¢ Long processing: Normal for large datasets, be patient
