>>> CAMERA CALIBRATION

Before performing 3D reconstruction, you need to calibrate your camera:

1. PREPARE CALIBRATION DATA:
   • Print a chessboard pattern
   • Take 15-30 photos of the chessboard from different angles and distances
   • Ensure the entire chessboard is visible in each image
   • Or record a video moving the chessboard around

2. RUN CALIBRATION:
   • Go to "Camera Calibration" tab
   • Select your calibration images directory or video file
   • Set the correct chessboard size (inner corners count)
   • For video: adjust frame skip (30 = process every 30th frame)
   • Click "Run Camera Calibration"
   • The camera matrix (K) will be saved automatically to camera_matrix.txt

>>> STRUCTURE FROM MOTION (3D RECONSTRUCTION)

After camera calibration, create your 3D model:

1. PREPARE INPUT DATA:
   • Take multiple photos of your object from different viewpoints
   • Ensure good overlap between consecutive images (60-80%)
   • Use consistent lighting and avoid reflective surfaces
   • Or record a video moving around the object

2. RUN 3D RECONSTRUCTION:
   • Go to "Structure from Motion" tab
   • Select your image directory or video file
   • Browse and select the camera matrix file (K) from calibration
   • Choose output format (PLY or OBJ)
   • Click "Start 3D Reconstruction"
   • The 3D points will be saved automatically to result.ply or result.obj

>>> WORKFLOW SUMMARY:

1. Calibrate camera using chessboard pattern
2. Capture images/video of target object
3. Run Structure from Motion with calibrated camera
4. View results in 3D modeling software (Blender, MeshLab, etc.) or use web like https://imagetostl.com/view-ply-online
